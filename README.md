# pragmatic-rejection
A dataset of crowdsourced judgements on whether utterances considered "pragmatic rejections" have acceptance or rejection force.

The data contains 60 examples of pragmatic rejections (as described in [1]) extracted manually from the BNC, AMI and Switchboard corpora [2,3,4], as well as 30 test items used in the crowdsourcing study.

The data is categorised according to the annotation scheme of [1].

For every datapoint, the results of the crowdsourcing experiment are given, where participants were asked to categorise the dialogue on a 4 point scale:

- B definitely meant to agree with A’s statement.
- B probably meant to agree with A’s statement.
- B definitely meant to disagree with A’s statement.
- B probably meant to disagree with A’s statement.
